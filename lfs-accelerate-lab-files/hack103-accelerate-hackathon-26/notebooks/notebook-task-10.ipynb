        "## Scenario\n",
        "\n",
        "Cymbal Retail’s \"Living Spaces\" initiative is reimagining the digital storefront by shifting from individual gadgets to curated home atmospheres, like \"focus sanctuaries\" or \"vibrant social hubs.\" To measure the success of this high-end home automation expansion, the leadership team needs a real-world impact analysis of the Illinois market.\n",
        "\n",
        "To provide rapid insights, you utilize the Data Science Agent in Colab Enterprise. By automating the complex Python workflows—from joining massive tables to identifying deep statistical correlations and turn \"cold\" data into a strategic narrative for the \"Living Spaces\" expansion.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your Mission\n",
        "\n",
        "Your mission is to perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to prepare for an upcoming executive briefing. You will guide the Data Science Agent to consolidate raw transaction data and perform a deep dive into the Illinois market.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Consolidate the Data:** Use the agent to perform a multi-table join across `product_master`, `customer_master`, and `pos_transactions` to create a unified history table named `customer_purchases_history`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Audit Data Quality:** Leverage the agent to proactively detect statistical outliers and missing values. You must not only identify these gaps but also apply the agent’s recommended imputation strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Analyze Local Market Dynamics:** Focus your analysis on the City-level (not state) for the Illinois market. You will look for hidden correlations between numerical features, such as product price and customer loyalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Visualize for Stakeholders:** Generate high-impact visualizations, including Pie Charts for geographic distribution and a suite of statistical plots (Histograms, Box Plots, and Scatter Plots) that tell the story of the \"Living Spaces\" collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Optimize for Performance:** Ensure the generated code is efficient and follows the constraint of being under 95 lines for the final reporting block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** In this notebook, you can use the code **generate** capability in Colab Enterprise to generate the code."
